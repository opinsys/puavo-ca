The subdirectory example.org contains some code to create certificates
needed by Puavo-CA.  Copy it as it is to a path of your choice, for
example to /etc/puavo-ca/example.org.  Replace example.org with your
toplevel domain, for example:

	cp -R example.org /etc/puavo-ca/opinsys.fi

First you should create a root CA-certificate and a sub-CA-certificate
for servers.  You may do this by typing:

	cd /etc/puavo-ca/example.org && sudo make

You will be asked twice for a password to encrypt the root CA-certificate,
and twice again for a separate server CA-certificate (these should
probably be different).  Root CA-certificate is used to sign both
the server CA-sertificate and the organisation CA-certificates.
Server CA-certificate is used to sign server certificates.

Edit /etc/puavo-ca/example.org/organisations/LIST to
contain a list of organisations, separated by newlines.  Edit
/etc/puavo-ca/example.org/servers/SERVERLIST to contain a list of servers,
again separated by newlines.  Each server line may contain server aliases
after the certificate name.  You may create the organisation certificates
and server certificates listed in those files by typing again:

	cd /etc/puavo-ca/example.org && sudo make

You will be asked for the root CA key password (that you previously gave)
once for each organisation certificate and the server CA key password
once for each server certificate.

You should also tell the web software the path to look for organisation
certificates by configuring in config/puavo.yml the parameter
"certdirpath" to point to "/etc/puavo-ca/example.org/organisations".
Puavo-CA will use the organisation certificates to sign the
host certificate requests that are sent to it.
